        <h2>What data does this project collect?</h2>
        <p>
            This project collects the following data from all participants:<br>
            - Your username<br>
            - Your password (encrypted using a <i>hash function</i> in storage)<br>
            - Your course codes and times, used for matchmaking<br>
            This project optionally collects additional data if you customize your profile page:<br>
            - Your display name<br>
            - Your profile picture<br>
            - Your pronoun display badges<br>
            - Your profile description text<br>
            - Your page theme<br> 
        </p>
        <h2>How does this project protect your password?</h2>
        <p>
            As previously stated, your password is encrypted before it is ever stored by this project.<br>
            This is done through hashing, or a mathematical function that is difficult to reverse.<br>
            Your hashed password would be near impossible to deduce your actual password from,<br>
            but only your actual password could produce that same hashed password.<br>
            Each time you log in, your password is compared against the stored hash to verify your identity.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>How is other data stored by this project?</h2>
        <p>
            User data besides your password is not encrypted by this project.<br>
            This information is stored in plaintext alongside your hashed password in server storage.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Why is your password encrypted, but not other information?</h2>
        <p>
            Encrypting your password is also imperative for your security from <i>credential stuffing</i> attacks.<br>
            If user data was ever to be maliciously retrieved from server storage,<br>
            any users who reused passwords on this site would be at risk of their accounts on other sites being breached.<br>
            <br>
            The primary reason that your other data is not encrypted is because I do not own the server this project is hosted on.<br>
            This project is hosted on the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department's student servers.<br>
            I cannot install any tool that does not currently exist on these servers,<br>
            and some tools that would provide this security require adminstrator privileges I do not have.<br>
            I was not able to find a tool suitable for this task during the development of this project.<br>
            <br>
            I can encrypt your password as you should be the only user capable of accessing that information.<br>
            Encrypting other data is more complicated, as multiple users should be capable of accessing this data.<br>
            <br>
            I am not going to code a custom encryption tool for this data for an additional reason:<br>
            <i>User transparency.</i><br>
            I do not want to present your data as being more secure than it actually is,<br>
            and unless I was using a tool that was used by industry professionals,<br>
            I would find it dishonest to state that your data is stored encrypted.<br>  
        </p>
        <h2>Can I request my data?</h2>
        <p>
            Once this project is live, you will be able to request all data associated with your account.<br>
            The button below will be able to create a .JSON file containing all user data.<br>
        </p>
