I am officially starting the project.
My goal is to create a webpage that:
- Leverages the existing public_html architecture
- Has an encrypted user database that stores usernames, passwords, and user data
- Once a user is logged in, allows for the collection of course information (course code, times, dates)
- Allows Housing and Exec members to create Profile pages

My highest priority for the project is I need to get a working encrypted login.
I don't know how to do that right now, and if I can't make that work then this project is not worth continuing.
I have an obligation to make this project secure.

I have come to the decision on what I will be doing for encryption protection.

It is within my power to encrypt people's passwords with hash_password() in PHP.
Password protection is my primary concern for this project regardless,
as credential stuffing (using a leaked password for entry on a secure site) is the most dangerous outcome of this project.
I should also not be able to see someone else's password on this project period.

I have thought about data encryption, and I don't think there is a reasonable way to do so with the architecture I have.
I don't think I can run mySQL on the cycle servers with at least one superuser command.
Additionally, the data does not seem like it would be of reasonable risk.
For a person outside of the userbase, the project is inherently doxxing by its nature.
Simply being a member reveals location data, and there's nothing I can do against that.
The only concern of mine would be a member of the userbase getting access to the whole list,
and that doesn't seem like preventing it would be super feasible.
Besides, a user can edit their own data to find out this information.
