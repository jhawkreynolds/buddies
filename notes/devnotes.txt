I am officially starting the project.
My goal is to create a webpage that:
- Leverages the existing public_html architecture
- Has an encrypted user database that stores usernames, passwords, and user data
- Once a user is logged in, allows for the collection of course information (course code, times, dates)
- Allows Housing and Exec members to create Profile pages

My highest priority for the project is I need to get a working encrypted login.
I don't know how to do that right now, and if I can't make that work then this project is not worth continuing.
I have an obligation to make this project secure.
